Controller (C) Model   
The Controller (C) model is responsible for determining the course of actions to take in order to maximize the expected cumulative reward of the agent during a rollout of the environment. In our experiments, we deliberately make C as simple and small as possible, and trained separately from V and M, so that most of our agentâ€™s complexity resides in the world model (V and M).   

C is a simple single layer linear model that maps z(t) and h(t) directly to action a(t) at each time step:

a(t) = Wc [z(t) h(t)] + bc

In this linear model, Wc and bc are the weight matrix and bias vector that maps the concatenated input vector [z(t) h(t)] to the output action vector a(t).
